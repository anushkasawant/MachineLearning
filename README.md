COVID-19 PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

What is Covid-19 Virus?

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without

Like middle-aged and older adults, children with obesity, diabetes, asthma or chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, or who are immunocompromised can also be at increased risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.



OBJECTIVE 


By looking into this dataset the pre-conditions would also help us make a smarter decision whether we should go to the hospital

or keep ourselves home quarantined and not overload the hospitals. Some patients need health care facility much more than

others. Hence, we must be considerate while making such choice known whether you are in danger or not from being affected by

covid-19.
